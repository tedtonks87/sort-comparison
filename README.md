# sort-comparison
a program to compare the speed of sorts on different size inputs

This is a program to compare the speed of mergesort and insertion sort on randomly generated lists of integers.
Over 1000 trials of increasing n by 10 until mergesort was faster than insertion sort, this program found on average
that mergesort was faster after about 765 elements were in the array being sorted.
